Important note about the dataset used:

For this unit assignment I will be using a self-procured dataset of NBA game statistics
from 2014-2018. These boxscores were scraped ethically from https://www.basketball-reference.com/
The database is stored locally and for purposes of this exercise I have generated
CSVs of desired metrics.

The purpose of this dataset is for predicting probabilites of a team winning to 
cover a certain sportbook's spread. Therefore, a n-day moving average was applied
to each statistic prior to the game to assess a team's momentum in each metric. 

The philosophy of this dataset is that in any given NBA game each team has 240
minutes of player time to win. While points per game is a simple measure I believe
it discredits other facets of the game such as defensive metrics. Therefore I have
engineered a feature I declare the "gamma" parameter.

For any given team gamma is given as a summation of the n-day moving averages:

       Stat                     Weight
Three Pointers Made                3
Field Goals Made                   2       
Free Throws Made                   1
Offensive Rebounds                 1 
Defensive Rebounds                 1
Steals                             1
Blocks                            0.5
Assists                           0.5
Turnovers                         -1
Field Goals Missed                -2
Three Pointers Missed             -3
Free Throws Missed                -1

These weights are arbitrary and model performance most likely could be improved
via an optimization. Gamma was calculated for both the home team and the away team.

    The best performing model was the Linear Discriminant Analysis, but all models
    perform relatively well. If we wanted to blindly trust a model to predict if
    the home team was going to win the game or not we could use LDA. It is both
    time efficent has ~equal precision and recall, meaning the false positive and
    false negative rates are roughly the same in the prediction.
    
    KNN performed the worst.
    
    Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
    Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

    In other words, precision is our ability to guess correctly weighted by 
    how many times we guessed the outcome but were wrong. Recall is our ability to
    guess correctly weighted by how many times we missed a proper prediction.
    
    KNN Precision and Recall
    
    Home Team Loss: Precision = 0.68, Recall = 0.78
    Home Team Wins: Precision = 0.75, Recall = 0.63
    
    Therefore the KNN  biases itself towards the home team losing. A lower
    precision with predicting losses shows we predicted more losses that were incorrect
    than wins. The recall being 0.78 shows that the number of times the home
    team was predicted to win but actually lost is lower than the number of times 
    they were predicted to lose but actually won. Therefore we should trust the KNN
    prediction more if it predicts the home team to win.
    
    The other model with drastically different precisions and recalls is the
    quadratic SVM model. Interestingly this model has the opposite bias of the
    KNN model in that it wants to predict that the home team will win.
    
    Home Team Loss: Precision = 0.78, Recall = 0.63
    Home Team Wins: Precision = 0.69, Recall = 0.82
    
    If we apply the same logic as before, we see that given a prediction that the 
    home team loses results in a smaller amount of relative false positives than
    if the model predicts a win. 
    
    The rest of the models have relatively unremarkable differences in recall and
    precision. 
    
    We could combine the logic of multiple models to further enhance out ability
    to make predictions. For example, we know that KNN wants to strongly favor
    the home team losing, the QSVM wants to favor the home team winning and our
    best model, the LDA is relatively agnostic, but has the best predicitve
    capability. Some scenarios exists that could shape our prediction
    
    Of note:
        LDA predictions are non-biased
        KNN biases home team losing (predictions of wins are welcome)
        QSVM biases home team winning (predictions of losses are welcome)
    
    Scenario 1: LDA predicts a win, QSVM predicts a win and KNN predicts a win
    
    In this scenario we know that QSVM wants to bias towards the home team winning
    and predicts a win, which is insignificnt. Yet, the KNN wants to bias the
    home team losing and we see it still predicts a win. Given this is opposite
    its bias and that LDA predicts a win, could this enhance the probability
    that we are correct in our prediction that the home team will win?
    
    This question I will answer in question number three. I will train two
    neural networks. One where the input parameters are simpy the gamma values 
    for the home and away teams, and the other will be the predictions of the
    LDA/KNN/QSVM models
