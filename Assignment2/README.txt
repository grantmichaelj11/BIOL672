MichaelGrant_unit2_BIOL672: Contains the answers/code to problem numbers: 1 and 2
MichaelGrant_unit2_Classifiers_BIOL672: Contains neural network, gradient boosted and random forest classifiers for part of problem number 3 and all of question 4
MichaelGrant_unit2_NNTesting_BIOL672: Contains the model neural netowrk trained on >20,000 entries of California Housing data and compares the number of processors to training speed and the number of layers to accuracy (i.e. it answers the rest of number 3)

classifier_analysis - TXT files of outputs from each classifier used in this assignment
classifier_plots - PNG files of the decision boundary plots
neural_network_plots - Contains two plots, processors vs training speed and number of layers vs MSE

MANOVA_NBA_gammas.txt shows the variance between each seaons gamma values are due to randomness and therefore we can use all 4 seasons indiscriminantly.
